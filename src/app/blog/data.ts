    title: "The Ultimate Guide to Email Deliverability",
    excerpt:
      "Ensure your emails reach the inbox, not the spam folder, with these proven deliverability best practices and technical setup tips.",
    content: `
        <p class="lead">Email deliverability is the foundation of any successful email marketing campaign. If your emails don't reach the inbox, nothing else matters. This guide covers everything you need to know to maximize your deliverability rates.</p>
        
        <h2>Understanding Email Deliverability</h2>
        <p>Email deliverability refers to the ability to deliver emails to recipients' inboxes. It's affected by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sender reputation</li>
          <li>Authentication protocols</li>
          <li>Email content and structure</li>
          <li>Recipient engagement</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Technical Setup for Maximum Deliverability</h2>
        <p>Proper technical setup is crucial for good deliverability. Here are the key components:</p>
        <h3>SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</h3>
        <p>SPF specifies which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of your domain.</p>
        <div class="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md my-6">
          <p><strong>Example SPF record:</strong></p>
          <code>v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net ~all</code>
        </div>
        
        <h3>DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</h3>
        <p>DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails that verifies they haven't been tampered with.</p>
        <div class="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md my-6">
          <p><strong>Example DKIM setup:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Generate a public/private key pair</li>
            <li>Add the public key to your DNS records</li>
            <li>Configure your email service to sign emails with the private key</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h3>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)</h3>
        <p>DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM to provide clear instructions on how to handle authentication failures.</p>
        <div class="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md my-6">
          <p><strong>Example DMARC record:</strong></p>
          <code>v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; pct=100; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com</code>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Content Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Even with perfect technical setup, your content can trigger spam filters. Follow these best practices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid spam trigger words like "free," "guarantee," and excessive punctuation</li>
          <li>Maintain a good text-to-image ratio (aim for at least 60% text)</li>
          <li>Use a clear, recognizable sender name</li>
          <li>Write compelling subject lines that accurately reflect your content</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Improving email deliverability is an ongoing process that requires attention to both technical details and content quality. By implementing the strategies in this guide, you'll significantly increase the chances of your emails reaching the inbox.</p>
