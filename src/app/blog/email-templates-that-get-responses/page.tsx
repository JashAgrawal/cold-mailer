            <h2>Why Most Cold Emails Fail</h2>
            <p>
              Before diving into the templates, it's important to understand why most cold emails fail. The three most common reasons are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>They're too generic and don't speak to the recipient's specific needs</li>
              <li>They focus too much on the sender instead of providing value to the recipient</li>
              <li>They lack a clear, compelling call-to-action</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Template #1: The Problem-Solution Approach</h2>
            <p>
              This template works by identifying a specific problem your prospect likely has and offering a clear solution. It's direct, value-focused, and has a 35% average response rate.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md my-6">
              <p><strong>Subject:</strong> [Problem] â†’ [Solution] for [Company Name]</p>
              <p><strong>Body:</strong></p>

            <h2>Template #2: The Mutual Connection</h2>
            <p>
              Leveraging a mutual connection significantly increases your chances of getting a response. This template has a 42% average response rate.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md my-6">
              <p><strong>Subject:</strong> [Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out</p>
              <p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
              <p>Hi [First Name],</p>
              <p>[Mutual Connection] mentioned you're [current situation or challenge they're facing].</p>

            <p>
              The remaining templates follow similar principles but are tailored for different scenarios. The key is personalization, providing clear value, and having a specific call-to-action.
